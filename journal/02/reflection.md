# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I was able to put a lot of hours in. Lots of things clicked really well after Tuesday and by the end of this week I feel confident with functions, parameters, and arguments.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?

That you can use single = sings in an if statement?? and updating HTML is surprisingly easy with JS

- What are you struggling with?

I think what the hardest part of JS so far this week has been being really consistent about console.log everything to make sure that I'm in the right place doing the right thing before writing code.

- What would you count as a victory?

I struggled on Whiteboard Wednesday. But was able to figure out that to reverse a string I need to do a reverse for loop. I think that was a good logical solution that is difficult to come up with if you don't already now.
