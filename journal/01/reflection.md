# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
It was a lot of fun meeting all of the fellow students, and warming up to some actual coding again. I feel pretty comfortable with html and CSS and i'm excited about the course now.

- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
The amount of pre-coded classes in bootstrap is pretty surprising for me. I thought many web developers were making most of their assets and pages with CSS, HTML, and JS instead of the bootstrap framework.

- What are you struggling with?
I think the concepts are making sense, but building some very clean code can be difficult! And the way that CSS interacts with the Bootstrap can be a bit weird as well. 

- What would you count as a victory?
I think I have learned rapidly, and I know it will get harder so I'll take the wins while I can get them! And I like all of my fellow Cohort so far!
