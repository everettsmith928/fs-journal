# JavaScript
script src = app.js

primitive data types:

number, string, boolean, 
'' can use + to add to string
numbers are floats in js

truthy falsy = numbers can behave as a true or false.
you can use 0 in place of false;
you can use any number in place of true;

an empty string '' will return as false
anything in ' ' string will return as true

undefined is read as false
null is read as false 

an empty object or array will return true

undefined : I don't know there is no value
  undeclared variable and empty value
null
  no value : Knowing there is no value

Reference data Types
  let arr = [''] - uses arr for array

  Objects = KEY, VALUE PAIRS
     obj = [
      key: value
      num:
      boolean: true
     ]

     obj.key
     you can iterate over an object. Does not have an order

If you share the value in a reference type you dont make a copy and modify the storage value.
any other variables you create a copy.

Functions

Blocks of code that do things and be stored for access later
 function var(parameter){
  code block
  return; gives back values
 }

 built in fuctions;

 Modify data in the JS and apply the data to the page.

 Array Methods;
 Alias assigns variable let animal = animal[i] so you can animal.name, animal.emoji

.find() : returns value of first found element
.filter() : write a conditional that iterates over an array
.map() : returns an array that matched the result
.join() : turn elements into a string and join them with a seperating string
predicate function: a callback that has a condition and has to return something
 forEach(): array method. do something for each index in the array
 Anonymous FUnction: a function that is ran but is never saved () => {};


 Argument: value that is passed through the parameter. if its a function don't include ();
 callback : Take in a function description and run it.

 img tag usually get img-fluid : matches the shortest axis to the longest axis of the parent element

 Any placeholder string that changes using interpolation to inject html, we must declare outside the for loop.
